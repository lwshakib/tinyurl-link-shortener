## 🛠️ Local Development Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone
- Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
- Clone your fork locally:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tinyurl-link-shortener.git

Always create a new branch for your work:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# OR
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-name
```

### Step 2: Develop and Test
- Run `pnpm dev` to see your changes in real-time.
- Ensure all quality checks pass before committing:
  ```bash
  pnpm lint       # Checks for code style issues
  pnpm typecheck  # Verifies TypeScript types
  pnpm build     # Ensures the project compiles
  ```

### Step 3: Commit and Push
Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for your messages:
- `feat: ...` for new features
- `fix: ...` for bug fixes
- `docs: ...` for documentation

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your descriptive message"
git push origin your-branch-name
